# FormBlurryBkgNET

Blurry background form is a developement of Android system's like blurry forms.
This is a sample form that shows background form as a blurry image in transparent form background style and is able to simulate form move and can be uses for multiple screens.

For GuassianBlue class uses another developers code wich I dont remember who was it.
If anyone is owner of blur class please message me so I can place refrence in the code.

Enjoy it.
